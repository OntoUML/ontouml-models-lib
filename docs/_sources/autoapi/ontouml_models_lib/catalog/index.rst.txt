==========================

.. py:module:: ontouml_models_lib.catalog

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   The `catalog` module provides the `Catalog` class, designed to manage and query collections of ontology models within the OntoUML/UFO Catalog.

   This module facilitates the loading, querying, and compilation of results from multiple
   ontology models, leveraging RDFLib for RDF graph operations and SPARQL queries.

   Overview
   --------
   The `Catalog` class is a specialized manager for handling a set of ontology models, each stored in its subdirectory
   within a specified catalog path. Each subdirectory is expected to contain an ontology file (`ontology.ttl`) and an
   optional metadata file (`metadata.yaml`). The class supports complex queries across the entire collection by compiling
   results from individual models into a cohesive dataset.

   Usage
   -----
   To use the `Catalog` class, instantiate it with the path to the catalog directory. The class will automatically load
   all ontology models from their respective subdirectories. Users can then perform SPARQL queries across the catalog,
   either on individual models or across the entire collection.

   Examples
   --------
   Example 1: Loading a Catalog and Executing a Single Query on All Models

       >>> from catalog import Catalog
       >>> from query import Query

       >>> # Initialize the catalog with the path to the directory
       >>> catalog = Catalog('/path/to/catalog')

       >>> # Load a specific query from a file
       >>> query = Query('./queries/query1.sparql')

       >>> # Execute the query on all models in the catalog
       >>> catalog.execute_query_on_all_models(query)

   Example 2: Filtering Models by Attributes and Executing Multiple Queries

       >>> from catalog import Catalog
       >>> from query import Query

       >>> # Initialize the catalog
       >>> catalog = Catalog('/path/to/catalog')

       >>> # Filter models that have the keyword 'ontology' or are in English language
       >>> filtered_models = catalog.get_models(language="en")

       >>> # Load multiple queries from a directory
       >>> queries = Query.load_queries('./queries')

       >>> # Execute the queries on the filtered models
       >>> catalog.execute_queries_on_models(queries, filtered_models)

   Example 3: Executing Multiple Queries on a Specific Model

       >>> from catalog import Catalog
       >>> from query import Query

       >>> # Initialize the catalog
       >>> catalog = Catalog('/path/to/catalog')

       >>> # Get a specific model by ID
       >>> model = catalog.get_model('some_model_id')

       >>> # Load multiple queries from a directory
       >>> queries = Query.load_queries('./queries')

       >>> # Execute the queries on the specific model
       >>> catalog.execute_queries_on_model(queries, model)

   Dependencies
   ------------
   - **rdflib**: For RDF graph operations and SPARQL query execution.
   - **loguru**: For logging operations and debugging information.
   - **pandas**: For compiling and managing query results in tabular format.

Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: Catalog(catalog_path)

   Bases: :py:obj:`ontouml_models_lib.utils.queryable_element.QueryableElement`


   Manages a collection of ontology models in the OntoUML/UFO Catalog.

   The `Catalog` class allows loading, managing, and executing queries on multiple ontology models. It compiles the
   results from individual models into a cohesive dataset, enabling complex queries across the entire catalog. This
   class inherits from `QueryableElement`, which provides functionality to execute SPARQL queries using RDFLib.

   :ivar path: The path to the catalog directory.
   :vartype path: str
   :ivar path_models: The path to the directory containing the ontology model subfolders.
   :vartype path_models: str
   :ivar models: A list of `Model` instances representing the loaded ontology models.
   :vartype models: list[Model]
   :ivar graph: An RDFLib `Graph` object representing the merged graph of all ontology models.
   :vartype graph: rdflib.Graph

   Examples
   --------
   Basic usage example of the `Catalog` class:

       >>> from catalog import Catalog
       >>> from query import Query

       >>> # Initialize the catalog with the path to the directory
       >>> catalog = Catalog('/path/to/catalog')

       >>> # Load a specific query from a file
       >>> query = Query('./queries/query.sparql')

       >>> # Execute the query on all models in the catalog
       >>> catalog.execute_query_on_all_models(query)

       >>> # Execute multiple queries on all models in the catalog
       >>> queries = Query.load_queries('./queries')
       >>> catalog.execute_queries_on_all_models(queries)

       >>> # Execute multiple queries on a specific model
       >>> model = catalog.get_model('some_model_id')
       >>> catalog.execute_queries_on_model(queries, model)

   .. py:method:: remove_model_by_id(model_id)

      Remove a model from the catalog by its ID.

   .. py:method:: _load_models()

      Load all ontology models from the specified directory.

      This method is called internally by the initializer to scan the catalog directory for subfolders, each
      representing an ontology model. It loads the models from these subfolders and initializes them as instances of
      the `Model` class. The loaded models are stored in the `models` attribute.

      :raises FileNotFoundError: If the catalog path does not contain any model subfolders.



   .. py:method:: _get_subfolders()

      Get the names of all subfolders in the catalog catalog_path.

      Create a single RDFLib model_graph by merging all graphs from the models.



   .. py:method:: _generate_compiled_results(results, compiled_file_path)

      Generate a compiled CSV file from results of all models.



   .. py:method:: _match_model(model, filters, operand)

      Check if a model matches the given attribute restrictions.

      :param model: The model to check.
      :type model: Model
      :param filters: Attribute restrictions to filter models.
      :type filters: dict
      :param operand: Logical operand for combining filters ("and" or "or").
      :type operand: str
      :return: True if the model matches the restrictions, False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: _match_single_filter(model, attr, value)

      Check if a model matches a single attribute restriction.

      :param model: The model to check.
      :type model: Model
      :param attr: The attribute name to filter by.
      :type attr: str
      :param value: The attribute value or list of values to filter by.
      :type value: Any
      :return: True if the model matches the restriction, False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool
